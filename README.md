## General description

URLL is a very basic language for storing and managing lists of hyperlinks. URLL uses the `*.urll` file format to store 1 or more link in a list. Comments are supported when a shebang/hashpling is added, and various link handling libraries are built-in.

See: [:octocat: `URLL Specification`](https://github.com/seanpm2001/URLL-Specification/)
